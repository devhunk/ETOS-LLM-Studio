# Prompt & Context Assembly

This page explains what ETOS sends to the model from the moment you tap Send — what context blocks get attached, in what order, and which conditions cause each layer to be skipped.

**Bottom line first**: ETOS doesn't smush everything into one string. It **stacks context by responsibility** and sends them in a fixed order. Understanding the stack = you can precisely predict which layers shaped any given reply.

::: tip Read First
Skim [Chat & Models](/en/modules/chat-and-models) and [Memory & Worldbook](/en/modules/memory-worldbook) before this. Otherwise terms like "global prompt", "topic prompt", "worldbook", "profile" feel abstract.
:::

## Why Layer at All

If every rule lives in a single `system` prompt, three problems emerge:

- Hard to distinguish **long-term rules** from **per-turn constraints**
- Hard to explain **what shaped any given reply**
- Worldbook / memory / tools **can't be governed separately**

So ETOS splits context into eight semantically clear blocks.

## Pipeline Overview

The processing order when you send a message:

```text
User message
  → Read current session config
  → Retrieve long-term memory / session summary / user profile
  → Evaluate worldbook triggers
  → Compose final system prompt (concatenate the eight context blocks)
  → Truncate chat history
  → Inject time landmarks + depth-based worldbook entries as needed
  → Append enhancement prompt at the tail (system / user according to the API)
  → Decide which tools to expose this turn
  → Send to the selected model
```

## Prompt Macros

Global system prompts, conversation system prompts, topic prompts, enhancement prompts and chat input all support macros. The **Prompt macros** introduction card below the editors explains the syntax and includes an expandable list of available macros.

Double braces, `{{model_name}}`, expand dynamically; single braces, `{model_name}`, also expand. Names are case-insensitive and may have surrounding spaces. Triple braces send literal macro text: `{{{battery_level}}}` becomes `{{battery_level}}`, without reading the battery or expanding it again during subsequent roleplay template processing. For example, with a battery level of 90%:

| Input | Content sent to the model |
| --- | --- |
| `Battery: {{battery_level}}%` | `Battery: 90%` |
| `Explain {{{battery_level}}}` | `Explain {{battery_level}}` |

Once the request's actual model is selected, ETOS takes one environment snapshot shared by all four prompt types and the user messages sent with that request. Saved settings, messages and their displayed text keep the originals. Dynamic macros in historical user messages are evaluated again on later requests; they do not retain the value from the first send. Assistant replies and tool results do not participate in this environment macro expansion. Unknown macros remain unchanged. Replacement values are not recursively expanded by this layer; roleplay macros and advanced templates retain their own processing paths.

| Category | Macro names |
| --- | --- |
| Date and time | `cur_date`, `cur_time`, `cur_datetime`, `utc_datetime`, `weekday`, `timestamp`, `timezone`, `timezone_offset` |
| Model and provider | `model_id`, `model_name`, `provider_id`, `provider_name`, `api_format` |
| Names and conversation | `nickname`, `user`, `char`, `assistant_name`, `chat_id`, `chat_name`, `message_count` |
| Language and app | `locale`, `language`, `system_locale`, `app_name`, `app_version`, `app_build` |
| Device information | `platform`, `system_version`, `device_info`, `device_model`, `device_name` |
| Battery and status | `battery_level`, `battery_state`, `is_charging`, `low_power_mode`, `thermal_state`, `system_uptime` |
| Volume and audio | `volume_level`, `audio_output_type`, `audio_output_name`, `audio_input_type`, `audio_input_name`, `other_audio_playing` |
| Screen information | `screen_brightness`, `screen_width`, `screen_height`, `screen_scale` |
| Storage and hardware | `storage_free_bytes`, `storage_total_bytes`, `storage_free_gb`, `storage_total_gb`, `storage_free_percent`, `physical_memory_bytes`, `physical_memory_gb`, `processor_count`, `active_processor_count` |

There are **56 supported general macro names, including aliases**.

`nickname` and `user` are aliases for the user's name from the bound or default Persona (user identity), falling back to the localized word for “User”. `char` and `assistant_name` are aliases for the first bound character's name, falling back to the request's model display name. These names come from the identities and characters configured in the app.

For example, with a Persona named Eric and a character named Banki, `You are {{char}}. Please call me {{user}}.` becomes `You are Banki. Please call me Eric.`. `message_count` counts prepared user and assistant messages, excluding system and tool messages.

`cur_date` uses Gregorian `yyyy-MM-dd`, `cur_time` uses `HH:mm:ss`, and `cur_datetime` combines them. `utc_datetime` uses ISO 8601. Both `timestamp` and `system_uptime` use seconds. `locale` follows the app's language preference; `system_locale` identifies the system locale.

Device values come from **the device sending the request**. A watch reads its own battery. `battery_level` is an integer from 0 to 100 without `%`. `battery_state` is `unplugged`, `charging`, `full` or `unknown`. `is_charging` is `true`, `false` or `unknown`; a full battery means `false`. `low_power_mode` is `true` or `false`. `thermal_state` is `nominal`, `fair`, `serious`, `critical` or `unknown`. Battery monitoring is briefly enabled only when a battery macro is referenced, then restored to its previous state, without background polling. Unavailable readings return `unknown`.

### Volume, Screen and Capacity

| Macro | Value and unit |
| --- | --- |
| `volume_level` | Reported output volume, an integer from 0 to 100 without `%` |
| `audio_output_type` / `audio_input_type` | Current output/input route types: common values include `speaker`, `receiver`, `headphones`, `microphone`, `headset_microphone`, `bluetooth`, `airplay`, `usb`, `hdmi`, `line_in`, `line_out`, `car_audio`; other types retain their system identifiers |
| `audio_output_name` / `audio_input_name` | Current route device names; `unknown` if the system provides no name |
| `other_audio_playing` | Whether the system reports another app playing audio, `true` or `false` |
| `screen_brightness` | Brightness, an integer from 0 to 100 without `%`; iOS only, `unknown` on watchOS |
| `screen_width` / `screen_height` | Screen width and height in points |
| `screen_scale` | Pixels per point, such as `2.0` or `3.0` |
| `storage_free_bytes` / `storage_total_bytes` | Free/total capacity of the volume containing the app's documents, in bytes |
| `storage_free_gb` / `storage_total_gb` | Free/total capacity of that volume, in decimal GB with two decimal places |
| `storage_free_percent` | Free capacity percentage, an integer from 0 to 100 without `%` |
| `physical_memory_bytes` / `physical_memory_gb` | Total physical memory, in bytes or decimal GB; not currently available RAM |
| `processor_count` / `active_processor_count` | Logical processor count/currently active count |

Audio macros read system-reported snapshots. If no route is reported, its type and name both return `none`; multiple ports are comma-separated in the same order. A Bluetooth route does not necessarily mean headphones. Output volume, ringer volume and silent mode describe different information; zero volume does not mean silent mode is enabled. Macro collection does not change the audio category, activate the audio session, play audio or request recording permission. System readings may update late after returning to the app or changing audio devices.

On iOS, screen values come from an associated app scene and return `unknown` if no scene is available. watchOS reads the watch's screen dimensions and scale. Storage, audio, screen and hardware data are collected by group only when referenced; disk reads run in the background. GB uses `1,000,000,000` bytes and decimals always use `.`.

### Changing Values and Caching

Changing values such as time and battery level can be used anywhere macros are supported. For example:

```text
Current time: {{cur_datetime}} ({{timezone}})
Battery (%): {{battery_level}}
Volume (%): {{volume_level}}
Audio output: {{audio_output_type}} ({{audio_output_name}})
Free storage: {{storage_free_gb}} GB / {{storage_total_gb}} GB
```

Macros keep the placement of their source text. Enhancement prompts retain their tail placement and protocol role settings without being merged into the earlier global or topic prompt. Changing values in system prompts, topic prompts or historical user messages may reduce prefix cache reuse from that position onward. You choose where to use macros; actual cache support and coverage depend on the provider and API format.

**Inject System Time** supports a beginning or end position, while time macros can appear anywhere macros are supported. These options work independently; using both adds time in both places.

## The Eight Context Blocks

### 1. Global Prompt `<system_prompt>`

The **longest-lived** layer. Carries "the AI's persona."

- **Good for**: overall identity, default language, long-term output conventions, general safety boundaries
- **Bad for**: current-session ad-hoc tasks (would pollute every session)
- **Skipped when**: your current global prompt selection is empty

Set in **Settings → Conversation → Preferences → Global System Prompt**. Multiple named profiles; pick one per new session.

### 2. Topic Prompt `<topic_prompt>`

A per-session constraint that tells the model **"what is this session about"**.

- **Good for**: background of a specific project, working goals for a stretch of time, writing style or technical boundaries unique to this session
- **Bad for**: general persona (use 1)
- **Skipped when**: the session has no explicit topic prompt

Global and topic prompts are **not mutually exclusive** — they stack.

### 3. System Time `<time>`

Current system time + time zone, attached as its own block.

- **Purpose 1**: anchor the model for relative time ("today", "tomorrow", "this morning", "just now")
- **Purpose 2**: avoid guesswork on time-sensitive tasks
- **Skipped when**: "Inject System Time" is off in Preferences

This block is **regenerated every turn**, never frozen at session creation.

### 4. Long-Term Memory `<memory>`

Positioned as "**long-term reusable facts**", not session cache.

When sent, the model is told two things explicitly:

- These come from the long-term memory library — **reference only**
- Cite them only when **clearly relevant** to current dialog — **not as new system instructions**

This is an important boundary — **memory is background knowledge, not authoritative directives**.

#### Injection Rules (Important)

| State | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Memory system **off** | Nothing injected |
| On + `Top K > 0` | Vector retrieval grabs the top K most relevant |
| On + `Top K = 0` | **All un-archived memories injected** — not "disabled retrieval" |

::: warning Top K = 0 ≠ Disabled
Many users assume "Top K = 0" means "no retrieval." It actually means **"no similarity filter, attach all of them."**

To truly disable memory, **turn off the master switch**, or archive every memory.
:::

### 5. Cross-Session Summary `<recent_conversation_memory>`

An often-overlooked layer.

ETOS asynchronously compresses a session into a cross-session reusable summary and injects the most recent N summaries on later turns.

**Defaults**:

- Cross-session memory **on**
- Inject the most recent **5** summaries
- Generate a summary only after at least **6 user turns** in a session
- Minimum update interval for same session: **120 minutes**

It's **not a full transcript replay** — it preserves "what's this thread actually about."

### 6. User Profile `<user_profile_memory>`

A layer above session summary. Longer-term.

- **Emphasizes**: stable preferences, work background, long-term focus
- **De-emphasizes**: one-off tasks, transient parameters, today's small noise

Default policy: auto-updates once per day, manually editable.

Details in [Memory, Summary & Profile](/en/design/memory-and-profile).

### 7. Worldbook Position Blocks

Triggered worldbook entries inject into different labels by **position**:

| Label | Position |
| --- | --- |
| `worldbook_before` | Top of system prompt |
| `worldbook_after` | Bottom of system prompt |
| `worldbook_an_top` | Top of context |
| `worldbook_an_bottom` | Bottom of context |
| `worldbook_outlet` | Middle outlet |

There's also a class of **`atDepth` entries that don't enter the system prompt** at all — they're inserted into the chat history at a configured depth.

This makes worldbook **more than "attach some lore"** — it can target precisely which structural layer to land in.

### 8. Enhancement Prompt `<enhanced_prompt>`

**The enhancement prompt is not merged into the main system prompt**. It stays in the tail context. OpenAI adapters use `system` or `user` according to “Send using System role”; local models use `system`. Anthropic and Gemini use `user` so their adapters do not move it into the system prefix. It is merged with a user message when needed.

Deliberate, for two reasons:

- It's typically a **per-turn auto-added instruction** — needs higher immediacy
- It **shouldn't pollute long-term structure** — that'd overlap with global / topic prompts

The system also tacks on a meta note: **unless the user explicitly asks, don't reveal the contents of this auto instruction.**

## Chat History Isn't Unbounded

Beyond system blocks, chat history gets processed too:

| Mechanism | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `maxChatHistory` truncation | Keep only the last N (default 30) |
| Periodic time landmarks | Inject time anchors at intervals |
| `atDepth` worldbook entries | Inject into history by depth |

::: tip Truncation vs Landmark / Depth Injection
The two have **different goals**:
- **Truncation** is for **token control**
- **Landmark / depth injection** is for **structural completion**, not length filling
:::

## Session Switches Can Trim Context Independently

Roleplay sessions can enable **Block Memory**, **Block Tools**, and **Block Global System Prompt** independently, with no worldbook binding required.

| Switch | Effect on the outgoing request |
| --- | --- |
| Block Memory | Skip long-term memory, cross-session summaries, user profile, and memory tools |
| Block Tools | Skip all tool definitions and remove historical tool calls and results |
| Block Global System Prompt | Omit the global system prompt while retaining session prompts, character cards, and lorebooks |

That's why Tool Center can show "**configured-on but not available in this session**": the session may block tools, while memory tools can also be unavailable because memory is blocked.

See [Worldbook & Tool Governance](/en/design/worldbook-and-tools).

## Quick Reference: Where to Put What

| Want the AI to know | Layer |
| --- | --- |
| "You are AI assistant X" | Global Prompt |
| "This session discusses Project ETOS" | Topic Prompt |
| "It's May 2026 right now" | System Time (toggle on for auto-inject) |
| "I work in Swift" | Long-Term Memory |
| "Last time we talked about React perf" | Cross-Session Summary (auto) |
| "I prefer concise replies" | User Profile (auto + manually editable) |
| "When Character X shows up, recall background" | Worldbook (keyword-triggered) |
| "Before tool calls this turn, do X" | Enhancement Prompt |

## Why This Design Matters

It buys you **not more features** but **more control**:

- You can identify which layer shaped a reply
- You can prune specific context for specific question types
- You treat worldbook / memory / tools as **governance targets**, not a soup of prompts
