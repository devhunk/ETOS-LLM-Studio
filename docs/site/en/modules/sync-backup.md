title: Sync & Backup
description: Two-way iPhone ↔ Apple Watch sync; snapshots, ETOS bundles, S3 / R2 upload, and third-party import for every migration and recovery scenario.

# Sync & Backup

ETOS stores everything in a local SQLite database. That means:

- **Great for privacy** — nothing leaves the device by default
- **Risk** — phone lost / wiped / app uninstalled = **all data gone**

This page covers how to **prevent that**: two-way sync, multiple backup paths, cross-app import.

## What This Page Covers

| Topic | Solves |
| --- | --- |
| **iPhone ↔ Watch Sync** | Real-time two-way device data |
| **iCloud Sync** | Multi-iPhone roaming, second-iPhone takeover |
| **Snapshot Backup** | DB corruption rollback; device migration |
| **S3 / R2 Upload** | Long-term object storage of backups |
| **Third-party Import** | Migrate from other LLM clients |

### Where

```
Settings → Display & Experience → Sync & Backup
```

Key sections inside:

- Database Protection (manual snapshots)
- Apple Watch Sync
- iCloud Sync
- iCloud Status

### Apple Watch Sync

#### Turn It On

Enable **"Enable Apple Watch Sync"**. The footer explains:

> When on, the iPhone and Apple Watch fully roam supported data; when off, near-field sync inbound data is rejected.

It uses **LAN direct connection** — as long as iPhone and Watch are on the same Wi-Fi (or within Bluetooth range), they sync directly, with **no external server**.

#### What Syncs

| Data type | Synced? |
| --- | --- |
| Sessions and messages | ✅ |
| Provider configs (incl. API keys) | ✅ |
| Enabled models | ✅ |
| Memories | ✅ |
| Worldbooks | ✅ |
| MCP server configs | ✅ |
| Daily Pulse history | ✅ |
| Wallpapers / custom fonts | ⚪ Depends on device capability |
| Tool call traces | ❌ Not synced (data volume too high) |

#### Manual Sync

Normally both ends stay in lockstep. If something didn't propagate, the "Apple Watch Sync" section has a **Sync** button to trigger one manually.

#### Sync Status

The **Apple Watch Status** section shows:

- ✅ **Sync Success** with last sync time
- ❌ **Sync Failed** with error
- ⚪ **No Sync Yet**

### iCloud Sync

**Different from Apple Watch sync — they're two independent mechanisms**:

| Dimension | Apple Watch Sync | iCloud Sync |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | iPhone ↔ Watch data flow | Multi-iPhone roaming / disaster recovery |
| Transport | LAN direct | Apple iCloud Drive |
| Frequency | Real-time on every change | Background periodic |
| Best for | Same person, multiple devices | Switching iPhones / second iPhone |

#### Turn It On

**"Enable iCloud Sync"** lets you manually **"Sync to iCloud"**.

> Used for roaming data across multiple devices under the same Apple ID. Leave off if only one device uses the app; turning it on uploads a snapshot of this device and merges with snapshots from other devices, **including provider API keys synced across your devices**.

::: warning API Keys Roam Too
Turning on iCloud sync means your LLM API keys also **encrypt and upload to your iCloud**. Apple can't see them, but make sure your Apple ID has **two-factor authentication**.
:::

### Snapshot Backups (Most Important)

The **Database Snapshot** button (cloud-up arrow) opens the full snapshot backup / restore page.

#### Two Snapshot Types

| Type | Includes | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Database Snapshot** | Chat, config, memory DBs | Small (a few MB) |
| **Full Snapshot** | DBs + wallpapers + audio + image + file attachments + custom fonts + memory vector index | Large (depends on attachments) |

Default to **Full Snapshot**. Database Snapshot if storage is tight.

#### Encryption

**"Set Password"** encrypts the snapshot. Adding **"Strong Derivation"** uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 with 256,000 iterations — slower (a few seconds extra) but more secure.

::: danger Lost Password = Lost Backup
ETOS doesn't store your password. **Forgetting it means the backup is permanently unrecoverable.** Use a password manager.
:::

#### "Create iCloud Drive Snapshot"

Writes the snapshot to iCloud Drive's **ETOS LLM Studio Backups** folder:

> The snapshot is written to iCloud Drive's "ETOS LLM Studio Backups" folder; if iCloud Documents capability isn't enabled, the system writes to the local Documents/ folder with the same name.

Files have the `.elsbackup` extension.

#### Restore

Bottom of the page, **"Restore from Snapshot"** → pick a `.elsbackup` file → enter password (if any).

> Restore replaces the current chat, config, and memory databases; a full snapshot also restores wallpapers, attachments, fonts, and the memory vector index file. **Choose a trusted `.elsbackup` file.**

After restore: "Snapshot restored. If the current screen still shows old data, return to the session list and re-enter."

Snapshots preserve Linux settings in the database, but exclude local Linux system, Home, Shared, workspace, and export files. After reinstalling the app and restoring a snapshot, Linux installs the built-in system on first use. Previously installed packages and workspace files are not restored, and external folders may need authorization again. Resetting Linux stops it and clears the system; installation happens on the next use, so a reset does not depend on a successful startup.

#### Launch Backup Point

**"Create Database Backup on Launch"** dumps a recoverable backup to disk on every app launch.

> Manual snapshots are for cross-device disaster recovery; launch backups protect against SQLite database corruption.

Cheap insurance — lets you roll back to the last launch state if something breaks.

### Import from Another Client

Settings → Display & Experience → Sync & Backup → **Third-Party Import** (or the entry inside the snapshot page).

Pick a **Source**:

| Source | Format |
| --- | --- |
| **Cherry Studio** | Full `backup.zip` |
| **RikkaHub** | Exported JSON |
| **Kelivo** | Exported JSON |
| **ChatGPT Official** | `conversations.json` |
| **ETOS** | `.elsbackup` or ETOS bundle |

After choosing, tap **"Select File and Parse"** to pick the file in Files.

Selecting an `.elsbackup` file opens the same confirmation flow as **Restore from Snapshot**. Both plain and encrypted snapshots restore the databases covered by the snapshot. watchOS uses this flow for downloaded `.elsbackup` files as well. Legacy ETOS JSON bundles and data from other clients continue to use the import preview and merge flow.

After parsing you'll see an **import summary**: how many providers, sessions, memories, MCPs, Skills, worldbooks will be added.

Confirm to write to the database.

::: tip Back Up First Before Bulk Imports
If you've been using ETOS already and want to import a large batch, **take a full snapshot first**. If the import pollutes the database, you can restore with one tap.

### Upload to S3 / R2 / Any Compatible Object Store

The snapshot page's bottom **"S3-Compatible Object Storage"** section uploads snapshots to external object storage:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Endpoint | `https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` (R2) or AWS S3 endpoint |
| Region | `auto` (R2) or `us-east-1` (AWS) etc. |
| Bucket | Bucket name |
| Backup Key Prefix (optional) | Prefix, e.g. `etos/iphone-15-pro/` |
| Access Key ID | Generated from your S3/R2 console |
| Secret Access Key | Same |
| Session Token (optional) | Only for temporary credentials |

**"Upload to S3/R2"** uses AWS Signature V4 to PUT the `.elsbackup` to `bucket/prefix/filename`.

Best for:

- Weekly full snapshots stored in the cloud long-term
- Multi-device shared backup repo
- Using cheap R2 / B2 / Wasabi instead of iCloud Drive

### Database vs Full Snapshot — Which to Pick

| Situation | Pick |
| --- | --- |
| Regular backup | Database (small, fast) |
| Switching phones | Full (with attachments, fonts) |
| Debugging / sharing with developer | Database (redact and share) |
| Storage-tight (iCloud 200GB full) | Database + manage attachments separately |

### Cross-Phone Watch Takeover

Watch data depends on the iPhone for sync. **To move the Watch to a new iPhone**:

1. Install ETOS LLM Studio on the new iPhone
2. Full snapshot on old phone → AirDrop or iCloud to new phone
3. Restore snapshot on new phone
4. Pair Watch to new phone (system pairing, not ETOS)
5. Enable Apple Watch sync in ETOS settings → data auto-flows over

### Sync Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Watch shows "Not Synced" | Bluetooth off / different Wi-Fi | Check connection; manual Sync |
| Sync failed | Data format incompatibility | Check error log; file feedback |
| iCloud stuck spinning | iCloud Drive network issue | System Settings → check iCloud status |
| Cross-device data conflict | Both ends edited simultaneously | Last write wins. **Configure on iPhone only**, use Watch to read |

### Launch Backup Physical Location

Launch backups live in the app sandbox. They **do not** auto-sync to iCloud or cloud.

For long-term retention you must **periodically take full snapshots** to iCloud Drive or S3.

### App exits while preparing a backup

Before upload progress appears, the app exports databases, removes rebuildable search indexes, compacts and compresses the copy, and applies password encryption if selected. The compressed backup size does not represent the memory needed during preparation.

If the issue persists after updating, reopen **App Logs on the affected device**, choose the date, and open the file containing `snapshot` in its name. Check the last entries in the `Snapshot` category; API request logging does not need to be enabled. Checkpoints are persisted before each step and include elapsed time, current memory usage, file size, and free disk space. They exclude conversations, backup passwords, and S3/R2 credentials.

`database.vacuum.begin` identifies database compaction; `archive` identifies compression; `encryption` identifies password encryption; `upload.sign.begin` identifies upload signing; and `upload.request.begin` precedes the network request. A missing completion entry does not distinguish memory termination, a system interruption, or manually closing the app. Look for `JetsamEvent` reports as well: [memory termination reports differ from ordinary crash reports](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/identifying-high-memory-use-with-jetsam-event-reports), so a missing app IPS report on the phone does not establish that backup preparation succeeded.
