# Debug & Feedback

ETOS LLM Studio puts more thought into "how do I figure out what went wrong" than most LLM clients. It includes a **LAN debug client**, **app log archive**, **API traffic analysis**, and a **PoW-protected ticketed feedback system**. This page covers what each is and when to reach for it.

## Problems You're Likely to Hit

| Symptom | Reach for |
| --- | --- |
| AI reply didn't appear, error popup | **App Logs** for the exact error code |
| AI reply is nonsense | **API Traffic Analysis** to see the actual request and response |
| Want to file a bug | **Feedback Helper** |
| Want a computer to capture full request traces | **LAN Debug** |
| Want to inject a custom proxy / man-in-the-middle | **Local Debug Server Proxy** |

## Read This First

### App Logs (most-used)

#### Where

```
Settings → Extended Capabilities → Extended Features → App Logs
```

Or tap "View Logs" from an error popup.

#### What It Records

Daily folders named by date contain structured (JSON) logs of every request and response:

- Each LLM request's full URL, headers, body
- Each response (including streaming chunks)
- Tool call requests and returns
- Failure error codes / stack traces

#### "Record Plaintext Request Messages"

| State | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Off (default) | Request body logs **redact** `message`, `content`, etc. (structure visible, content hidden) |
| On | Records plaintext messages, but **image, audio, and file Base64 stays redacted** (avoids log explosion) |

::: warning Plaintext Logs Contain Sensitive Content
Turning on plaintext logging means **everything you chat about lands on disk**. If you don't want that record kept, leave it **off** and only flip it on during active debugging.
:::

#### How to Use

1. Reproduce the problem
2. Open App Logs, find today's folder
3. Locate the entry by timestamp
4. Read the error details

#### Cleanup

- Single day: **Swipe to Delete**
- **"Clear All"** wipes history (with confirmation)

### Feedback System

#### Where

```
Settings → Extended Capabilities → Extended Features → Feedback Helper
```

Or "Send Feedback" from certain error popups.

#### Filing Feedback

Each ticket includes:

- **Type**: Bug / Feature Request / Question / Other
- **Title** + **Body**
- **Environment info** (auto-captured): version, iOS version, device model, simulator status
- **Screenshots** (optional)
- **Log attachment** (optional): a redacted log zip

#### PoW Anti-Spam

Submission requires a **Proof of Work** — your device spends a few CPU seconds on a hash challenge. This is ETOS's spam guard: no email verification, but every ticket pays a small CPU cost.

#### Ticket Lifecycle

Submitted tickets get a number. The feedback list shows:

- **Status**: Unread / Read by Developer / In Progress / Resolved / Closed
- **Comment thread**: developers reply on the ticket; you reply back
- **Developer flags**: "Confirmed Bug", "Cannot Reproduce", "Fixed in Next Version", etc.

Descriptions and comments support Markdown headings, lists, emphasis, links and code blocks. Both iPhone and Apple Watch let you scroll through the full text; submitted feedback on the watch is no longer limited to eight lines.

When a developer references a ticket number in a commit message, such as `fix(tools): correct arguments #133`, GitHub-recognized commits appear in the timeline. Tap a commit for details. A new linked commit can trigger a notification even without a comment; it does not mean the fix has been released.

The app refreshes tickets that are not closed at launch, and you can also refresh manually. After fetching new replies, status changes or linked commits, it sends a local notification if system permission is granted. Each reference is reported once. These are not instant remote notifications while the app is closed. Existing tickets establish a baseline without notifying you about references from before the last check.

The feedback list, composer and ticket detail each declare their own page guide context. The guide can read status and whether fields are filled, but not feedback text, comments or ticket credentials. You review and submit the content yourself.

#### Two-way Tickets

- iPhone tickets sync to the Watch
- Local notifications report new activity after launch or a ticket refresh

### API Traffic Analysis

#### Where

```
Settings → Extended Capabilities → Extended Features → Advanced Diagnostics
```

#### Simple Mode (token usage only)

For just token usage and response speed, [Usage Analytics](/en/modules/chat-and-models) is enough.

#### Full Traffic Capture

**Advanced Diagnostics** captures the **complete flow** per request:

- Full URL (including query string)
- Full request headers (including Authorization)
- Full request body
- Full response headers
- Full response body (streaming-merged)

Best for figuring out "why did the AI say what it said."

## Advanced

### LAN Debug Mode

Top of Advanced Diagnostics, **Connection Mode**: choose **HTTP Polling** or **WebSocket**.

Use with the **PC-side debug tools** in `docs/debug-tools` and `docs/debug-tools-go`.

#### How It Works

> The device proactively connects to the PC-side WebSocket server, receives commands, and executes file operations.

The device **dials out** — no need to open router ports. The PC runs a WebSocket server (default port 8765); the device connects and lets you:

- Browse the app's sandbox files
- Pull the local database for diagnostics
- Upload / download files
- Watch a live console in a browser

#### Steps

1. PC: run the server in `docs/debug-tools/` (npm project)
2. PC server prints its **local IP + port** when started
3. iPhone: Advanced Diagnostics → enter "IP:port" (e.g. `192.168.1.100:8765`) → tap **Connect**
4. When green, watch the live log in your browser

::: warning Only on Trusted Networks
Advanced Diagnostics **fully exposes the app sandbox** to the PC. Don't use it on coffee-shop Wi-Fi or any public network.

The on-page warnings:
> Use only on trusted networks
> Disconnect promptly after use
:::

#### API Proxy Mode

The **API Proxy Settings** option routes all LLM requests through the PC-side man-in-the-middle:

```
Set API Base URL to: http://PC-IP:8080
```

Requests get logged, parsed, optionally modified, then forwarded to the real LLM API. Good for:

- Inspecting full streaming response content
- Writing your own middleware to alter requests / responses
- Mocking error responses to test app behavior

### Global Proxy (Production Networks)

```
Settings → Providers & Models → Global Proxy
```

If **every** LLM request needs a proxy:

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Enable Proxy | Master switch |
| Proxy Type | HTTP / HTTPS / SOCKS5 |
| Proxy Host | Hostname or IP |
| Port | 1–65535 |
| Username (optional) | Proxy auth |
| Password (optional) | Proxy auth |

**Priority** (covered in [Add Your First Provider](/en/guide/first-provider) advanced): per-provider proxy > global proxy.

Best for:

- Network-wide proxy requirement (corporate, VPN)
- You don't want to configure each provider separately

### Log Redaction Behavior

ETOS redacts by default:

| Field | Recorded |
| --- | --- |
| URL | ✅ Full |
| Headers | ✅ Full (Authorization included — **for debugging**; redact before sharing) |
| Body `messages` text | ❌ Hidden by default (turn on "Record Plaintext Messages" to include) |
| Body image base64 | ❌ Always hidden |
| Body audio base64 | ❌ Always hidden |
| Body file base64 | ❌ Always hidden |
| Streaming response body | ✅ Recorded merged |

::: tip Redact Again Before Sharing
Even with built-in redaction, logs still contain URLs and headers that may include API keys. **Before sharing** with a developer, do another pass: replace `Authorization` / `X-API-Key` etc. with `***`.
