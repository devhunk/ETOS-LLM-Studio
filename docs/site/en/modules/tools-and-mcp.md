# Tools & MCP

An LLM by itself just talks. To make it **act on the world** — fetch weather, query a database, write a file, hit GitHub — you have to give it **tools**. This page covers ETOS's three tool categories and how the **approval policy** keeps the AI from going rogue.

## Vocabulary First

### What a Tool Is

A tool is "a function the model can call." Each tool has a name, description, and parameter schema. When the model decides it needs a tool, it emits a call request; the app executes it for real and feeds the result back to the model to continue generating.

Concrete example: you ask "What's the weather in Beijing?" The AI doesn't know — but if you've given it a **weather tool**, it:

1. Outputs "call `getWeather` with `city=Beijing`"
2. The app actually queries the weather and feeds back ("Sunny, 22°C")
3. The AI uses that to produce its reply

Without tools, all the AI can say is "I can't query real-time weather."

### Three Categories in ETOS

| Category | Where it comes from | Managed in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **App Tools** (built-in) | Bundled in the app | Settings → Tool Center → App Tools |
| **MCP Tools** | MCP servers you connect | Settings → MCP Tool Integration |
| **Shortcut Tools** | iOS Shortcuts you expose | Settings → Shortcut Tool Integration |
| **Agent Skills** | Skill packs you import | Settings → Agent Skills |

::: tip All Independent
You can use only app tools, only MCP, or only Skills. Don't feel forced to enable all four because they exist.

### Tool Center — The Master Dashboard

**Settings → Tool Center** opens a single list of all tools. Each row has:

| Element | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Master switch (atop each section) | "Expose App Tools to Model" / "Expose MCP Tools to Model" — off blocks the whole category. |
| Per-tool switch | Individual control. You might want the model to have `getWeather` but not `executeShellCommand`. |
| Approval policy | How tool calls are gated. See below. |

A search field ("Search tools") appears when you have many tools.

### Device Support for Apple-Native Tools

Native tools appear only when supported by the current device, OS version, and hardware. Apple Watch omits clipboard, AlarmKit alarms, NFC, audio-file transcription, the system photo library, Vision image analysis, and writes to contacts, calendars, or reminders. These native operations are not delegated to iPhone. Supported weather, HomeKit, Bluetooth, and contact-reading tools run on the watch itself.

Listed tools may still require system permission, a network connection, or compatible accessories. Notification and media tools manage only notifications and players created by ETOS. Route calculation supports driving, walking, and cycling; use the Maps opening tool for public transit. The system URL tool on Apple Watch accepts only `tel` and `sms`.

### Approval Policies — Three Levels

This is the **most important concept** in the tool system. It stops the AI from running risky operations without your consent.

Each tool has three policy levels:

| Policy | Behavior | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ask Every Time** (default) | A confirmation bubble appears in chat when the AI tries to call this tool | Unfamiliar tools, or tools with side effects (file writes, HTTP calls) |
| **Always Allow** | Auto-approve, no interruption | You trust the tool (calculator, read-only weather) |
| **Always Deny** | The model can't call it; no prompt ever appears | You want this tool unavailable (e.g. don't let the AI touch files) |

#### What the Confirmation Bubble Looks Like

When policy is "Ask Every Time", the AI's tool call request shows up as a bubble with five buttons:

| Button | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **Allow** (green ✓) | Approve this one call |
| **Deny** (red ✗) | Refuse this call; the AI is told "user denied" |
| **Supplement** (blue) | Deny but add a follow-up prompt nudging the AI in a different direction |
| **Keep Allowing** (teal) | Approve this call **and** flip this tool's policy to "Always Allow" |
| **Full Access** (purple) | Approve this call **and** flip every tool's policy to "Always Allow" |

::: warning "Full Access" Is a Nuke Button
It strips guardrails from every tool at once. **Only use it once you fully understand the behavior of every enabled tool.**
:::

### App Tools (Built-in)

ETOS ships with a starter set:

| Tool | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **File ops** | Search, chunked read, diff, partial edit, move, copy, delete — **strictly inside the app sandbox**, not your whole filesystem |
| **SQLite** | Run queries against local databases |
| **Web Card** | Turn external links into card previews inside the chat |
| **Feedback** | Auto-submit a feedback ticket to the developer |
| **Math / Text** | Basic data operations |
| **Write Memory** | Let the AI proactively store user preferences / project context to long-term memory |

Toggle each in **Settings → Tool Center → App Tools**.

### Typical Workflows

#### Scenario 1: "Find files about X"

1. Settings → Tool Center → App Tools
2. Turn on "Expose App Tools to Model"
3. Enable "File Search" and "File Read"
4. Ask in chat: "Find Markdown notes mentioning 'year-end review'"
5. AI calls the file search tool → confirmation bubble → tap Allow
6. AI reports the matches

#### Scenario 2: "Summarize this webpage"

1. Settings → MCP Tool Integration → connect a Fetch MCP server (below)
2. In chat: "Summarize https://example.com/blog/abc"
3. AI calls Fetch tool → you approve → AI summarizes

### What MCP Is and Why It Matters

**MCP** (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol from Anthropic that defines **how an LLM client talks to an external tool server**.

Analogy:

- Before MCP: every LLM client wrote its own plugins; tools weren't portable.
- After MCP: a tool developer writes a server once, **any MCP-aware client (ETOS, Claude Desktop, Cursor, …) can use it**.

ETOS includes a full MCP client and **connects to any spec-compliant server** — both official ones (filesystem, github, postgres, puppeteer, etc.) and community projects (search, email, maps, SaaS APIs).

### Connect Your First MCP Server

**Where**: Settings → MCP Tool Integration → "+ Add MCP Server" in the top-right.

The "Add MCP Server" form:

#### Basic Info

| Field | What to put |
| --- | --- |
| Display Name | Your label, e.g. "GitHub MCP", "Web Fetch" |
| Transport | Three choices: **Streamable HTTP** (recommended), **SSE**, **HTTP**. Prefer Streamable HTTP. |

#### Endpoint

The server's actual URL. For a hypothetical fetch server, something like `https://fetch-mcp.example.com/mcp`. Check the server's own docs.

#### Authentication (optional)

If the server needs auth:

- **Bearer API Key** — paste a token, the most common case
- **OAuth 2.0** — the full flow with Token Endpoint, Client ID, Scope, etc.

#### Header Overrides (optional)

`key=value` expressions with a `{token}` placeholder that gets replaced with the Bearer API Key above:

```
Authorization=Bearer {token}
X-Org-ID=org_abc
```

#### Save → Handshake

After saving, ETOS attempts the MCP handshake automatically. On success, the server's published tool list appears in Tool Center.

### MCP Master Switch

**Settings → MCP Tool Integration → "Expose MCP Tools to Model"** is the one-tap kill switch.

> Off: no MCP tools go to the model, and any MCP calls in chat are ignored. Server connections, debugging, and per-tool config are preserved.

For when "I have MCPs configured but I don't want the AI using any tools today."

## Advanced

### Per-Session Tool Blocking

Some sessions you might want **with no tools at all** — e.g., a roleplay session with a specific Worldbook.

When a session enables **Block Tools**, Tool Center explains that the relevant context is blocked and the tool is not actually available. The AI cannot call any tool in that session. This switch is independent of memory and the global system prompt.

See [Memory & Worldbook](/en/modules/memory-worldbook) → Per-Session Context Blocking.

### MCP Server Debugging

Each MCP server's detail page shows:

- **Connection state** (connected / disconnected / error)
- **Tool list** the server publishes
- **Reconnect** button
- **Error log**

When a call fails, start here.

### Tool Source Labels

Tool Center rows show "**Source: xxx**" under MCP tools — the source is the MCP server's display name, so you know which server provides each tool.

### Tool Call Result Display

Tool results don't get jammed into the message body; they appear as **expandable cards**. Tap one to see:

- Full request parameters
- Full return value (JSON / text / image)
- Stack trace on failure
- Call duration

This is the most important entry point when debugging "why did the AI say that."
